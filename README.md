## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This is the first challenge I've taken on where, based on someone's recommendation, I wrote up a readme to attach to this project. Otherwise the project was
very easy. Though I typically like to avoid "width" properties in favor of max-width, I went with it here to get the desktop grid to look the way I wanted.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
    header {
        padding: 2.5rem;
        max-width: 44rem;
    }
```.price {
        border-radius: 0rem 0rem 0rem .5rem;
        padding: 2.5rem;
        display: flex;
        flex-direction: column;
        justify-content: space-evenly;
        width: 22rem;
    }
```.benefits {
        border-radius: 0rem 0rem .5rem 0rem;
        padding: 2.5rem;
        width: 22rem;
    }
